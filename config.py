"""
Central configuration for Agro Edge.

You mentioned you'll be running 4 separate ESP32 boards and haven't decided
the channel/field layout yet — that's fine. Every sensor below is looked up
through SENSOR_CHANNELS, so once a board is online you only need to fill in
its channel_id / read_api_key / field here. Until a channel_id is set, the
matching page will clearly say "sensor not configured yet" instead of
crashing, and (where sensible) will fall back to ambient weather data.

Typical layout for a 4-board setup:
  Board 1 (already live): soil moisture          -> existing channel 3467712
  Board 2: temperature + humidity (DHT/SHT)       -> one channel, 2 fields
  Board 3: water level / rain gauge (flood)       -> own channel
  Board 4: ESP32-S3 + OV2640 camera + LoRa uplink -> not on ThingSpeak;
           see pages/1_Live_Camera.py for how the live/webcam feed plugs in.
